        <p>PARC: Alignment</p>
        <h3>Pluralsight</h3>
        <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com" target="_blank">www.pluralsight.com</a>
        <img src="images/pluralsight.jpg" alt="A picture of the mobile view of Pluralsight's main webpage. It displays a header, a subheader, and some call to action buttons.">
        <p class="description">Pluralsight's website is a great example of the use of alignment as they have the text and call to action buttons all aligned left. Also, in the header, they have their logo left-aligned and to create a balance, they have their search and menu icons right-aligned. The audience is able to follow a natural alignment pathway as they view Pluralsight's website content.</p>

      <div class="two">
        <p>Visual Hierarchy</p>
        <h3>BambooHR</h3>
        <a href="https://www.bamboohr.com" target="_blank">www.bamboohr.com</a>
        <img src="images/bamboohr.jpg" alt="A picture of the mobile view of BambooHR's main webpage. It displays a header, a subheader, and some call to action buttons.">
        <p class="description">BambooHR's website shows an excellent example of visual hierarchy as your eyes are naturally drawn to the main header in the middle of the screen. From there, the hierarchy leads you to examine the call to action buttons, and then possibly backtrack to read the subtitle, ultimately guiding their audience with visual hierarchy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="three">
        <p>White Space</p>
        <h3>Thinkific</h3>
        <a href="https://www.thinkific.com" target="_blank">www.thinkific.com</a>
        <img src="images/thinkific.jpg" alt="A picture of the mobile view of Thinkific's main webpage. It displays a header, a subheader, a menu button, and some statistics about their business.">
        <p class="description">Thinkific's website is a beautiful example of how powerful white space can be when utilized correctly. They have simple, powerful statements orgaized neatly across the mobile layout and the space in between provides a simple, minimal feeling that keeps the audience content and engaged.</p>
