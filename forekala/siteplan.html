            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Did you know that 66% of Americans would struggle to pay cash for a $1,000 emergency? And 7 out of 10 couples do not budget consistently. I have always been fascinated by the discipline and knowledge of making money work for me instead of working for it. For this reason, I am creating a website that helps the average American get their finances in shape! 20% of the work is head knowledge and 80% is the motivation to get. it. done. My website is going to have the ability to easily and consistently budget finances and get the motivation to stay on track. This will be done with a budgeting tool, lessons about finances, calculators for a variety of financial topics, and more. Budgeting and financial discipline don't have to be difficult and with my proven methods, anyone can get organized and make it happen! My site will cover the topics of how to eliminate debt, save money for emergencies and build investments for retirement, college funds, traveling, etc. The three pages that my project will include will be one for debt, one for saving money, and one for investing. </p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>My target audience is going to include individuals mostly in their 20s and 30s who are getting their financial foundations established. The characteristics of my typical user will include individuals who are facing the repayment of student loans, auto payments, and in the early stages of paying on a mortgage. They will be young families, most with children, but some without as well. They will be willing to discuss finances as a family and have self-discipline to be wise about their spending. They will not be individuals who seek lavish lives or those who are thrill-seekers who can't live without spending money on whatever they want in that moment. </p>

            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <h3>Color Palette</h3>
            <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/3a65af-65a552-dbdbdb-ffffff"
            target="_blank">Forekala Color Palette</a></p>
            <table class="colors">
                <tr>
                    <th>Primary</th>
                    <th>Secondary</th>
                    <th>Accent 1</th>
                    <th>Accent 2</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="primary">[#3A65AF]</td>
                    <td class="secondary">[#65A552]</td>
                    <td class="accent1">[#DBDBDB]</td>
                    <td class="accent2">[#FFFFFF</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <h4>Heading Font: Heebo (regular 400)</h4>
            <p>I've chosen Heebo regular 400 as my heading font becaues of the simple, yet bold appearance it has. Forekala's solutions are meant to be just that - simple and bold.</p>
            <h4>Paragraph Font: Open Sans (light 300)</h4>
            <p>To compliment my Heebo heading font, I've chosen Open Sans Light 300 for my paragraph font. The lighter touch give a really nice contrast to the slightly heavier heading font weight</p>
            <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ex nisi iusto quis ut et vel illo mollitia maxime magnam nemo consequuntur, quod doloremque? Repellendus, dicta nisi. Exercitationem delectus atque enim repudiandae quod, nesciunt repellat. Commodi, ea. Suscipit vel fugit rerum minima mollitia cum excepturi esse laboriosam, doloremque dicta, illum quis?</p>
            <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
            <p class="colored">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. A consectetur perspiciatis consequuntur? Pariatur distinctio dolores sunt odit praesentium ducimus omnis quisquam, aliquam placeat facilis nihil obcaecati aspernatur laudantium corrupti. Aut, eum inventore voluptas numquam mollitia dolore praesentium pariatur ipsam sed veniam hic, quis impedit voluptatem totam iste laudantium dicta rerum.</p>
