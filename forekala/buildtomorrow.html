            <p class="buildtext1">Have you ever sacrificed something necessary for your own benefit or the benefit of your loved ones? It's an extremely rewarding feeling and building your future is waiting for you to make it happen! Retirement has never happened on accident for anyone (sorry, spoiler alert), and preparation and a little bit of sacrifice is the only way to make sure you're prepared. It's SO worth it and Forekala is here to help you build that plan, step by step, and help you rest assured that come time for retirement, that nest egg will be looking more like the egg of a golden goose. The hardest part is getting started, and once you have the momentum built up, it's easy sailing from there. </p>

            <p class="buildtext2">If you didn't have to get up each morning and go into work, what would you do with your time instead? Would you spend it with family and friends? Would you spend it working on projects around the house? Hobbies? Whatever your ideal life looks like, planning for retirement is the guaranteed pathway to that destination. Time is the universal currency of all human beings, regardless of location or societial differences. Time is what you're buying when you sacrifice now for a financially peaceful retirement. Time is a currency that you only get once and there's no getting it back once it's gone. So today is literally the best day for you to act. Schedule your free consultation below and let's make sure you earn all the time in the world tomorrow.</p>
